<div>General concepts needed to use Mash=>App effectively:</div>
<br/>
<div>A domain is a set of highly related app characteristics that define a significant aspect of the app's behavior and or development process.</div>
<div>Domain properties are next.</div>
<div>For example, UI, Dependency, Security, Tests, etc. etc.</div>
<div>Domains can have any degree of abstraction or are directly tied to the implementation. For example, HTML pages of a web application or solution architecture</div>
<div>Domains define the rules for transforming into each other.</div>
<br/>
<div>Tool - any development tool that takes into account the behavior of an app or its individual properties, which can be used to change objects of individual domains and is integrated with Mash=>App</div>
<br/>
<div>Script - a set of related domains and tools needed to automatically control the nature of an application or automatically modify application source codes and configurations</div>
