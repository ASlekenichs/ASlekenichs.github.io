The import wizard is designed to work with Figma, Sketch, Miro tools and is available from your personal profile on the Projects tab.
Run the wizard and:
Choose project name
Select a provider and link to board/sheet for import. If necessary, repeat the operation for each provider or board/sheet
If you have added access rights to the board/sheet or the entire project area to your profile, the system displays the Ok sign. Otherwise, the system will prompt you to log in on the side of the tool itself and issue access rights.
For comfortable work, we also recommend installing the plugin (see below)
After you finish selecting the necessary repositories, the system will open the workspace window, which will reflect the dynamics of the import process
After import, the File domain and all source code and configuration domains are automatically generated. An example is shown in the figure below. If all files of the imported project are recognized, the Ok sign will light up.
